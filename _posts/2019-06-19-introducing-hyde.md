title:  Dagger for Android Testing
---

Dagger is a powerful dependency injection framework for Android that simplifies the process of managing dependencies throughout your application. It can also be a valuable tool for writing clean and maintainable unit tests.

### Why use Dagger for Android testing?

There are several benefits to using Dagger for Android testing:

* Improved test isolation: By injecting dependencies through Dagger, you can ensure that your tests are not relying on any global state or hidden dependencies. This makes your tests more reliable and easier to debug
* Reduced boilerplate code: Dagger can automatically generate the code needed to create and inject dependencies, which can save you a lot of time and effort.
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Easier mocking: Dagger can be used to mock dependencies for your tests, which can be helpful for isolating specific parts of your code.
